Kaggle
======

I've posted some of my solutions to some intro Kaggle problems (the ones for knowledge). 
For each one of the competitions, I refrain from putting the train.csv, and test.csv into this repository (they can get huge). So assume that the correct files are located in each directory.

I will also post some solutions to real competitions, but only after the competitions have ended.

Also, I try to write up my thoughts as I'm thinking through the challenges, and so each directory should have a "walkthrough.txt". The name for this file is a reference to the old school days, when a young 11 year old me, got stuck in the water temple in ocarina of time, and had to download a 400 pg "walkthrough.txt". Hopefully, you will have more fun pouring over my walkthroughs, than I had in the water temple.

Have fun perusing at your leisure.
