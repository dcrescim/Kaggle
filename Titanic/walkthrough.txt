Basically we are trying to predict whether a given person survived or not (1 or 0). 

So immediately, I'm thinking we use either a logistic regression, random forest, or a linear SVC.

Quirks:
  - The dataset has a bunch of missing values for age, and cabin. So we are going to have to impute that.
  - Also the ticket column is very mysterious, sometimes its a number, other times there are random characters in front. Very weird.
  - 2 missing values for embarked. Gonna have to impute those as well.

Things I tried:
- 1. LinearSVC
  Not super hot.
- 2. Random Forest
  Better than the extra trees classifier this time
- 3. Extra Trees Classifier




Things I want to do
- Break the cabin letter out into its own categorical column
- Try some naive bayes
