Basically we are trying to predict what the demand will be for bikes over every hour interval in the last third of the month.

Things I did:
1. Break out the categorical columns like
  'weather', and 'season'

2. Take the datetime, and turned that into an 
  angle and broke out the sin, cos portions

3. Took the datetime and broke out the hour,
  into a categorical column (like 0, 1, ..., 23). 
  Then I broke out that categorical variable into 
  24 binary columns. 


Things I tried:
1. LinearSVC
  Eh, not that great.
2. RandomTreesRegressor
  Not sure why I check this model, when the ExtraTrees model always seems to do better.
3. ExtraTreesRegressor
  Best model so far. 

Some stuff that I still want to try
- 1. Try to predict not the total count, but the individual counts (registered and not) that combine into the total count. Maybe a model for each.
